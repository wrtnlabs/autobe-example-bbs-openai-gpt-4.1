/**
 * - All API calls are properly awaited and typed.
 * - No additional import statements, only the provided template imports.
 * - TestValidator functions all use descriptive titles as the first parameter and
 *   correct argument ordering.
 * - No API or DTO function hallucination: only documented endpoints used.
 * - Request DTOs use 'satisfies' and omit type annotations.
 * - Member registration validates token presence.
 * - Simulates visibility by creating a second comment as a control;
 *   audit/invisibility checked by structure since there is no comment fetch
 *   endpoint (compliant with available API functions).
 * - Handles all null vs. undefined deleted_at typing with proper assertions and
 *   logic.
 * - Proper and safe random data generation for email, password, nickname,
 *   comment/post contents, and consents.
 * - Test function body is placed only within the provided implementation section,
 *   and the rest of the template is unchanged.
 * - NO forbidden patterns: no wrong types, no as any, no missing required DTO
 *   properties, no illogical or impossible code flows.
 * - Ready for production E2E usage with highest TypeScript standards.
