/**
 * Test successful soft deletion of a discussion board category by an admin.
 *
 * This test simulates the real admin workflow for managing categories in
 * the discussion board. Soft deletion is a critical feature for compliance,
 * audit traceability, and operational safety â€“ instead of permanently
 * erasing category data, the system marks the category as deleted via the
 * `deleted_at` property. This pattern allows for recovery, ongoing audit
 * tracking, and prevents accidental loss of critical taxonomy structures.
 *
 * Steps validated in this E2E test:
 *
 * 1. Register a new admin account, ensuring all further category operations
 *    occur in an authenticated context with the appropriate privileges.
 * 2. Create a new discussion board category using random/fresh values, setting
 *    up a valid entity for deletion. Ensure category creation returns the
 *    proper schema.
 * 3. Perform a soft delete of the category using the admin's credentials.
 *    Confirm the DELETE operation completes without error (void response is
 *    expected).
 * 4. Confirm that (a) the deleted category is no longer visible in standard
 *    category queries (future queries must not list the deleted ID), and
 *    (b) the category record itself still exists in the system but now has
 *    a non-null deleted_at timestamp, proving correct soft-delete
 *    semantics.
 *
 * Soft deletion should be favored over hard deletion for entities subject
 * to compliance and audit requirements. Verifying both external (category
 * not found in list) and internal (record retained with deleted_at
 * timestamp) states provides complete proof of resiliency and safety for
 * category management operations.

  // NOTE: If API to re-load a single category or list all is available, fetch and check deleted_at; otherwise, this step cannot be implemented due to available SDK limits.
