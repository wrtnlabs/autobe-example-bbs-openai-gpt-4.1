/**
 * The draft implementation logically follows the scenario and all requirements:
 *
 * - All steps and dependencies are performed in proper order: member registration
 *   (with required consents), post creation, comment creation, comment
 *   deletion, and deletion log retrieval.
 * - Only template imports and DTO/types from materials are used, no additional
 *   imports.
 * - All requests and path parameters use the correct DTO/request types and tag
 *   constraints (e.g., UUID, email).
 * - All API/SDK function calls are properly awaited; no missing awaits.
 * - There are no type error tests, no missing required fields, no "as any"
 *   usages, and no attempts at HTTP status code testing.
 * - All business logic validations use descriptive titles, are placed after
 *   typia.assert, and avoid redundant type or property checks.
 * - Null/undefined handling is correct (uses ?. and makes no unneeded property
 *   accesses).
 * - The deletion log id is obtained using the comment id after erase (based on
 *   expected audit log semantics for this API set), with appropriate usage in
 *   the final GET call.
 * - Only documented DTOs and API function accessors are used; no hallucinated
 *   types or property names.
 * - The scenario is clear that self-deletion is being validated, so the business
 *   rule assertion for deletion_reason === "self_delete" is realistic and
 *   matched in the test.
 * - There is no modification of connection.headers and no context switching
 *   errors.
 * - Random data generation follows the constraints for all DTO fields.
 * - Function and parameter naming conventions match the template and
 *   requirements.
 * - All code is clean, commented, and within a single function as the template
 *   instructs.
 *
 * Therefore, the implementation is valid, follows all rules, and does not
 * require revision or correction. No errors to fix or code to delete were
 * found. The output is ready for final handoff.
