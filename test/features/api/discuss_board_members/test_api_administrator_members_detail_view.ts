/**
 * Validate administrator can retrieve detail view of a discussion board
 * member.
 *
 * This test creates an administrator and, using that context, creates a new
 * member with known values (random user_account_id, nickname, status). Then
 * it uses the returned memberId to call the detail view endpoint and
 * asserts the response fields match the created member (all primitives and
 * timestamps). Full DTO shape is typed as IDiscussBoardMembers.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Register a new administrator (email, password, nickname) and obtain
 *    authentication context.
 * 2. As administrator, create a member with random user_account_id (uuid),
 *    random nickname, and a status string (e.g., "active").
 * 3. Fetch the detail for the created memberId with the administrator context.
 * 4. Assert that all returned member fields (id, user_account_id, nickname,
 *    status, created_at, updated_at, deleted_at) match what was created as
 *    expected, and typia.assert passes.

/**
 * The draft follows the scenario well and correctly utilizes only the allowed
 * imports and DTOs. All TestValidator assertions have descriptive titles and
 * appear in the correct (actual, expected) order. The function strictly uses
 * api.functional.auth.administrator.join,
 * api.functional.discussBoard.administrator.members.create, and
 * api.functional.discussBoard.administrator.members.at, each with await.
 * Typia.assert is used immediately after every API response assignment. Random
 * email, uuid, and nickname are generated using typia.random and
 * RandomGenerator utilities. The only minor issue is the
 * TestValidator.predicate uses a hard-coded regex to check date-time, but per
 * requirements, no manual type validation is needed after typia.assert, and
 * date formats are already guaranteed by typia.assert. So those predicates
 * could arguably be omitted, but including them does not break any rules. All
 * rules and checklist are checked as true. No prohibited type error testing,
 * extra imports, or helper functions present. The function is clear, stepwise,
 * and correctly implements the business scenario.
 *
 * No errors found. Code is compilation-ready and follows all mandates. No type
 * mismatches or DTO confusion. No properties are invented or omitted. The
 * revise.final can be the same as the draft.
