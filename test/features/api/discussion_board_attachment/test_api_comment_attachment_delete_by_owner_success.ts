/**
 * Test the soft deletion of a comment attachment by its uploader/owner.
 *
 * Business context: Ensures that attachments uploaded to discussion
 * comments can be deleted by the uploader (owner) only, resulting in a
 * soft-delete (deleted_at is set, not a hard removal). Deleted attachments
 * are hidden from user views and preserve audit/compliance trails.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Create a new user (the uploader) and establish authenticated context.
 * 2. User creates a discussion thread.
 * 3. User creates a post in the thread.
 * 4. User posts a comment to the post.
 * 5. User uploads an attachment to the comment.
 * 6. User deletes (soft-deletes) the attachment from the comment via the
 *    delete API.
 * 7. Confirm the operation succeeds (expected void response).
 * 8. Optionally (if API supported), verify that the attachment is not listed
 *    in queries and that the deleted_at timestamp is set on the attachment
 *    resource (in this test, confirm as much as possible given available
 *    APIs).
 * 9. Validate that only the uploader can perform this deletion (main logic
 *    covered here â€“ cross-user forbidden scenario is handled in a separate
 *    test).
