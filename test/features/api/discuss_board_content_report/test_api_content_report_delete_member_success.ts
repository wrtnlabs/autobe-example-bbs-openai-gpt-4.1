/**
 * - All imports are from the provided template, and no additional imports are
 *   present.
 * - Function documentation is clear, covers the scenario and all steps.
 * - All required DTOs are used precisely (IJoin, ILogin, ICreate variants), and
 *   properties for creatables are never over-specified.
 * - Random data generation for password, nickname, and content fields uses proper
 *   utilities and constraints; paragraph() and content() methods are used
 *   correctly per params.
 * - Member authentication is done via join (register) and re-login to follow
 *   usual practice, no manual token/headers manipulation, and login is included
 *   for explicit context.
 * - Stepwise logic: join -> login -> post create -> content report create ->
 *   erase follows natural data dependencies and business logic.
 * - After creation, type assertions (typia.assert) on returned DTOs for all
 *   objects (authorized member, post, content report) are present and correct.
 * - TestValidator checks (equals, predicate) use proper descriptive titles,
 *   actual-first pattern, and correct property matching (reporter_member_id,
 *   post linkage, status, deleted_at is null before deletion).
 * - The DELETE operation (erase) is called with proper args and awaited; only the
 *   owner can call it, as tested by the flow (remains as positive-path test).
 * - No type errors, no wrong-type validation, no error code/status code testing,
 *   and no forbidden scenarios are present.
 * - No logic that tests for missing fields or forcibly triggers type errors; all
 *   type constraints are obeyed.
 * - No business or DTO confusion at any point, no property name hallucination,
 *   and all referenced fields strictly exist in the schemas.
 * - The test function implements exactly one scenario, stays within the template
 *   boundaries, and never adds or mutates external functions.
 * - Proper handling of nullables and optionals: deleted_at is validated
 *   pre-erase, no forced ! or problematic null coalescing.
 * - The code is clean, type-safe, and readable with clear logical separation of
 *   steps. No errors to fix. Code is ready as final.
