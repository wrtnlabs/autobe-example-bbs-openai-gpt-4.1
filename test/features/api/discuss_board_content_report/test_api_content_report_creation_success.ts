/**
 * Validates that a registered discuss board member can successfully create
 * a content report for a post.
 *
 * This verifies the full report workflow including prerequisite member
 * registration (with proper consents), post creation, and then reporting
 * that post for a policy violation. The test ensures report is stored and
 * attributed to original reporter, and all references (post, member) are
 * correct.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Register a new member with unique email, a secure password, a unique
 *    nickname, and all required policy consents (e.g., privacy_policy,
 *    terms_of_service).
 * 2. Authenticate as this member (SDK should issue needed token
 *    automatically).
 * 3. Create a new discuss board post using random title/body as this member.
 * 4. Submit a new content report targeting the created post, including a valid
 *    non-empty reason.
 * 5. Validate all critical fields of the report: id, content_type,
 *    content_post_id, reporter_member_id match expectation and are
 *    non-null, and that reason matches the request.

/**
 * - All required business steps are present and in logical order: member
 *   registration (with unique data and consent array), authenticated post
 *   creation, then reporting created post.
 * - Explicit random data generation is done for all user and post fields (using
 *   typia.random and RandomGenerator utilities with proper tag formats,
 *   constraints, and no missing required fields), with the correct satisfaction
 *   of DTO types.
 * - Consent array is structured to include privacy_policy and terms_of_service
 *   with version and action, satisfying compliance.
 * - Authentication is handled by SDK via the join method/response.
 * - Report creation references the newly created post via its id, uses correct
 *   content_type, reason (random paragraph with parameterization), and matches
 *   DTO.
 * - All assertions use required TestValidator title as first parameter and
 *   validate business logic, attribution, and field relationships as expected.
 * - Code follows all import, function signature, variable, and request body
 *   rules: all request body variables are const without type declarations, and
 *   no mutation occurs.
 * - No extra or omitted imports; only the template is used; code generation and
 *   type safety practices are followed.
 * - There are no type error tests, HTTP status code assertions, or forbidden
 *   business/logic patterns. API return values are asserted with
 *   typia.assert(), never with custom validators.
 * - No property-adding, non-existent properties, or field misnaming. All
 *   properties are verified present in DTOs; final step only checks existing
 *   fields.
 * - Null/undefined handling: No missing or nullable fields remain unchecked. All
 *   nullable fields (where present) are left untouched unless relevant. No code
 *   paths rely on non-null assertion. No bare non-null assertion operators
 *   used.
 * - Await: All async calls, including API calls and post creation, are properly
 *   awaited.
 * - Function structure, naming, and documentation meet requirements: one
 *   parameter only (connection), function name is correct, JSDoc comment added,
 *   and every code block is within the function body.
 * - There are no violations; all code is best-practice TypeScript as described in
 *   the prompt, with all business and technical checklist met. All business and
 *   code correctness criteria, from setup through validation, are satisfied.
