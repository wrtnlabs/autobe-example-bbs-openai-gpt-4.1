/**
 * The draft test function strictly follows E2E test system guidelines. All
 * roles are created and authenticated using only provided SDK and DTOs, and
 * type safety is observed for every variable. Null/undefined is handled using
 * typia.assert where needed. Data flows logically from admin/member
 * registration, post creation, content report, promotion to moderator, and
 * final deletion of the content report as moderator. Moderator promotion
 * correctly references both admin id and the member id. Proper authentication
 * context switching is handled before privileged actions. All API calls are
 * awaited. No additional imports or forbidden code patterns are present. Random
 * data includes minimum complexity for passwords and uses appropriate tags and
 * generators. There is no type error testing, and all TestValidator calls
 * include proper titles (note: this test does not require TestValidator
 * assertions since the erase endpoint returns void and business logic is
 * covered by test flow itself). The commentary and code structure is clear and
 * adheres to all documentation and scenario steps. No issues detected requiring
 * revision. Final output may be equivalent to draft.
