/**
 * Review of the draft implementation for
 * test_api_moderation_log_deletion_audit_compliance:
 *
 * - The function has excellent, comprehensive documentation, is fully
 *   implementable and reflects the business context and process with
 *   step-by-step logic.
 * - All required dependencies and setup steps (admin join, member creation,
 *   moderation action, moderation log) are performed and properly validated.
 * - All SDK API calls are properly awaited and their responses validated via
 *   typia.assert() for type safety. Variable naming is descriptive and reflects
 *   the real entities being modeled.
 * - The moderation log deletion is performed as the core happy path operation.
 *   Two error scenarios are tested: a non-existent log ID, and deleting the
 *   same log twice (simulating protected/deleted log) — both use
 *   TestValidator.error with appropriate await, title, and async callbacks.
 * - No additional imports, no fictional DTOs or SDK functions, and no type errors
 *   or violations are present. The expected DTO variants are used for all
 *   request bodies.
 * - Null/undefined handling is performed appropriately and all typia.random calls
 *   specify generic type parameters.
 * - All TestValidator functions include descriptive first-parameter titles.
 * - There is no testing of type errors, missing required fields, or HTTP status
 *   codes. No template code is modified outside the required function body.
 * - The code is clear, maintainable, and adheres to TypeScript best practices
 *   with no anti-patterns, illogical flows, or prohibited patterns.
 * - No copy-paste issues — all logic is original and properly tailored to this
 *   scenario.
 *
 * No errors or violations were found. The code is already production quality
 * and fully compliant with all checklist and rules.
