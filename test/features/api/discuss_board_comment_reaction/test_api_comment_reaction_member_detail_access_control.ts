/**
 * Validate detail retrieval and access control for comment reaction entity
 * by members.
 *
 * This test ensures:
 *
 * 1. A member (the owner of the reaction) can retrieve the full details of
 *    their own comment reaction.
 * 2. A different member cannot access another memberâ€™s reaction details
 *    (should be denied/access forbidden).
 * 3. The API returns a not found/error for a random, non-existent reactionId.
 *
 * Step-by-step:
 *
 * 1. Register the first member and keep their credentials (for later re-login
 *    if needed)
 * 2. As first member, create a discussBoard post
 * 3. As first member, add a comment to the post
 * 4. As first member, create a reaction (like or dislike) to the comment;
 *    capture reaction id
 * 5. As first member, retrieve the reaction detail via GET
 *    /discussBoard/member/commentReactions/{commentReactionId} and check
 *    full record
 * 6. Register the second member, keep their credentials
 * 7. Login (authenticate) as the second member (context switch)
 * 8. Try to retrieve the first member's reaction via the same endpoint; this
 *    must be denied (error/assertion)
 * 9. Try to retrieve a non-existent commentReactionId; confirm API returns
 *    error/not-found

/**
 * The draft implementation follows the scenario and all E2E requirements very
 * well:
 *
 * - All prerequisites are established: two members are registered via join
 *   endpoints, post and comment are created and logically connected, then the
 *   comment gets a reaction as required.
 * - Values for randomized/unique fields (emails, nicknames, passwords) are
 *   generated using the correct RandomGenerator and typia.random patterns.
 * - Authentication step is handled correctly. On member switching, the login
 *   endpoint is called appropriately with required credentials.
 * - API function invocations use `await` everywhere (checked for every call,
 *   including TestValidator.error async callbacks).
 * - All necessary type validations are done using typia.assert (after every
 *   entity creation and retrieval).
 * - Required business/authorization error scenarios are robustly tested (other
 *   member's access to reaction, and not-found scenario), with proper use of
 *   TestValidator.error for the negative test cases -- both have async
 *   callbacks and are properly awaited.
 * - No missing required fields, no type bypassing techniques, and only required
 *   and allowed properties are set on all DTOs. There is no use of as any or
 *   missing required fields testing.
 * - Variable declarations for body data use satisfies syntax, not type
 *   annotation.
 * - There are no additional import statements, template boundary is respected,
 *   and all validations, business logic, and edge cases requested in the
 *   scenario are covered.
 * - No status code introspection nor error message analysis, only business logic
 *   error and rejection patterns tested.
 * - Edge cases for null/undefined are not present (there are no nullable
 *   assignment issues in this scenario).
 * - All TestValidator functions include titles as the first parameter and respect
 *   placement/order.
 * - No helper functions outside the main implementation, no manipulation of
 *   connection.headers, and account context is switched only through join/login
 *   functions.
 *
 * No issues are found; the code is ready for production and passes all E2E test
 * requirements for correctness and security.
