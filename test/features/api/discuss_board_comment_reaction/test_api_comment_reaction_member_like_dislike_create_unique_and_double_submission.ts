 * 4. Member1 creates a 'like' reaction to that comment (should succeed)
 * 5. Member1 attempts to create another reaction ('dislike' or duplicate
 *    'like') to the same comment (should fail, only one allowed; expect
 *    business error)

 * 7. Register member2, authenticate
 * 8. Member2 reacts to the first comment as well (should succeed; unique

/**
 * All required elements are present and correctly implemented:
 *
 * - The function carefully establishes two distinct members, each with unique
 *   email, strong/mixed password, and explicit consent records of the correct
 *   structure and values (policy_type, policy_version, consent_action). All
 *   authentication steps are properly sequenced with no extraneous imports or
 *   mutations.
 * - Member 1 creates a post and comments as the post owner. Comment creation uses
 *   valid request data typed with RandomGenerator for content.
 * - Member 1's first reaction (like) to their own comment is created
 *   successfully. The response is thoroughly checked for both type correctness
 *   (typia.assert) and business outcome (reaction_type === 'like', comment_id
 *   linkage).
 * - The business rule—preventing duplicate reactions by the same member to the
 *   same comment—is enforced: a second reaction attempt is wrapped in await
 *   TestValidator.error, which is used correctly.
 * - Reaction to a different comment and reactions by a different member are each
 *   validated, and proper positive assertions are included for those paths as
 *   well.
 * - All await usage for API calls and error assertions are correct; there are no
 *   missing awaits or shallow promise assignments. The code maintains type
 *   safety throughout, uses only imported types and SDK functions, and makes no
 *   attempt to touch connection.headers (authentication is managed by joining
 *   as the correct user).
 * - Comprehensive commentary and proper documentation are present, describing
 *   each business step.
 * - Random data generation uses length and format tags as needed, ensuring no
 *   type constraint violations. At no point are type annotations with satisfies
 *   or improper mutable handling of request bodies present.
 * - TestValidator assertions are always actual-first, descriptive, and properly
 *   parameterized. No DTO confusion, no additional import statements, no
 *   type-safety bypasses.
 * - No unimplementable or type-error-inducing code is present.
 * - The checklist and rules are fully satisfied, and every point in the test
 *   generation prompt has been systematically checked and passed.
 *
 * No issues detected—this code is production-ready and passes all required
 * standards.
