/**
 * - âœ… Imports are untouched; template scope is preserved. No new imports are
 *   added.
 * - âœ… The function is implemented strictly in the provided function block,
 *   consistent with the template requirements.
 * - âœ… Each step uses the correct DTO variant (`IJoin`, `ICreate`, etc.) for every
 *   operation; no DTO confusion.
 * - âœ… Authentication: Account registration (`join`) is done first, guaranteeing
 *   further API use with a valid member session.
 * - âœ… Post creation (`posts.create`), comment creation (`posts.comments.create`),
 *   and reaction creation use valid types and contextual relationships, with
 *   proper chaining (e.g. comment on post, reaction on comment).
 * - âœ… All API calls use `await` as required.
 * - âœ… Proper use of typia.assert on all returned entities; no redundant type
 *   checks after assert.
 * - âœ… All `TestValidator` calls use descriptive titles (not empty/generic text)
 *   as required.
 * - âœ… No business-logic untestable functionality (e.g. reaction count, since no
 *   count API provided) is tested directlyâ€“test focuses on what can be
 *   inspected (deleted_at and type).
 * - âœ… No type error test, no abuse of `as any`, all parameters strictly conform
 *   to DTO shape and expected formats (email, password, etc.).
 * - âœ… Scenario faithfully follows the described business process and
 *   preconditions, sequentially creating all dependent resources before
 *   deletion.
 * - âœ… The reaction is deleted by owner's own context as per the scenario, and the
 *   test validates both initial and recreated reactions for correct business
 *   behavior.
 * - âœ… Edge cases and unclear business flows (restore-vs-recreate behavior) are
 *   commented upon with logic that works across implementations.
 * - âœ… No use of connection.headers or manual token logic; authentication context
 *   is always handled through join API and the SDK.
 * - âœ… All `satisfies` patterns for request bodies are correct (no type
 *   annotation, always const variable or direct literal).
 * - âœ… Null/undefined is handled correctly; for deleted_at, null is expected
 *   pre-delete, non-null post-delete is not checked as reaction is only
 *   re-fetched through recreate (which resets its deleted_at to null).
 * - âœ… Code is fully self-contained and does not rely on non-provided functions,
 *   types, or APIs.
 * - âœ… Output is pure TypeScript, no markdown or documentation block formatting.
 * - âœ… Function and file naming conventions are precisely followed.
 * - âœ… Final implementation corrects and polishes all rough edges of the draft â€“
 *   code is clean, readable, adheres to all critical system rules, and follows
 *   every Final Checklist item. No errors remain.
