/**
 * Validate the administrator soft-deletion of a member account via the
 * erase endpoint.
 *
 * This test covers the following workflow:
 *
 * 1. Register an administrator (using /auth/administrator/join) and set up
 *    privilege context.
 * 2. Register a member (using /auth/member/join) to create a user account and
 *    provide user_account_id.
 * 3. Create a member as administrator using the supplied user_account_id (via
 *    /discussBoard/administrator/members POST), capturing the memberId.
 * 4. Delete (soft-erase) the member via
 *    /discussBoard/administrator/members/{memberId} using admin
 *    privileges.
 *
 * After deletion, we would expect the member to have a deleted_at timestamp
 * if the detail endpoint was available (as per soft-deletion convention).
 * Due to the absence of a read API in the SDK, we instead assert successful
 * completion of the erase operation and rely on business workflow
 * correctness and runtime type validation for this state transition.

/**
 * The draft implementation thoroughly follows the scenario and code
 * requirements:
 *
 * - Proper admin and member registration using provided APIs and random/realistic
 *   data
 * - Consent list constructed explicitly (required consents provided)
 * - No additional imports or creative syntax; template untouched
 * - All function calls have await
 * - Type safety is strictly maintained. All DTOs used fully match SDK/DTO
 *   definitions, with no fictional properties or omitted required fields.
 * - All TestValidator functions provide descriptive titles as the first parameter
 * - The only type assertion is for user_account_id to match the required uuid
 *   tagged type
 * - Authentication is handled by invoking the relevant SDK API via admin join
 * - Logical comments and JSDoc document each step for clarity
 * - No type violation, no as any, no missing required fields, and no test of type
 *   validation
 * - No attempt to check the deleted_at field directly, as no detail/read API
 *   exists
 * - Business workflow and success/failure paths are addressed coherently for the
 *   available endpoints
 * - Test focuses on what is practically verifiable given the endpoint set
 *
 * There are no errors found, and no required fixes or deletions.
 *
 * The code is ready for production with clear, logical structure and
 * appropriate coverage.
