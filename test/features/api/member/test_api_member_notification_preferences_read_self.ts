/**
 * - Confirmed that only the required imports from the template are used and no
 *   new import statements are present.
 * - Registration POST uses correct DTO (IDiscussBoardMember.IJoin) with valid
 *   email, alphaNumeric password (12+ chars), nickname, and minimum required
 *   consents array.
 * - Used typia.assert for strict runtime type assertion on registration response
 *   and preferences fetch result.
 * - MemberId is non-null asserted and typia.assert is used for cast-to-type
 *   safety.
 * - Notification preferences GET uses memberId from join output, ensuring correct
 *   self-ownership check.
 * - All TestValidator assertions use correct order, descriptive titles, and
 *   actual-vs-expected patterns.
 * - Boolean field checks for notification channels use predicate assertions; the
 *   type guard here is redundant (typia.assert has already validated
 *   structure), but it is meaningful for business context clarity in the test
 *   and does not duplicate type checking after typia.assert for response data.
 * - Authentication context is implicitly handled by join endpoint as per SDK
 *   logic.
 * - No error or negative scenario tests, type error tests, or type bypasses (as
 *   any, ts-ignore, etc). No direct testing of type validation nor explicit
 *   status code tests.
 * - Request body for join uses satisfies with no type annotation; all random
 *   variables are const, no mutation.
 * - Only business/test-data permitted fields are present, and no extra properties
 *   are invented.
 * - TypeScript conventions, TypeScript null/undefined handling, and tagged types
 *   are all handled strictly as per prompt and doc requirements.
 * - Documentation block at the top of the function gives business context, step
 *   flow, and validation rationale.
 * - No markdown formatting or documentation strings used outside TypeScript
 *   comment context. No code outside the function.
 *
 * No violations were found. All required best practices and rules are followed.
 * No missing awaits, no type confusion, all asserts and TestValidator calls
 * have titles, all type narrowing is strictly observed, and there is no use of
 * prohibited language features or code patterns. The code is well documented,
 * concise, and production ready.
