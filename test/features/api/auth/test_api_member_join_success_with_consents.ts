 *    present and of correct type/format.
 * 4. Proper use of 'satisfies' for the body type.
 * 5. Await is used for every api.functional.* call.
 * 6. The result is validated with typia.assert.
 * 7. TestValidator is used with correct titles and parameter placements.
 * 8. All assertions use proper actual/expected ordering and descriptive titles.
 * 9. No prohibited patterns are found (no type error testing, no as any, no header
 *    manipulation, no fictional functions).
 * 10. All code is inside the main function and the scenario is clearly described at
 *     the top.
 * 11. No markdown syntax is present, only valid TypeScript code, and the template
 *     is fully followed.
 * 12. The scenario is 100% implementable, no prohibited scenario elements present.
 * 13. No additional code blocks or helper functions outside the function body.
 * 14. Compliance with all business, type, and template requirements is achieved.
