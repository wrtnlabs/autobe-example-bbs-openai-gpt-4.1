/**
 * Validate that a member with 'suspended', 'locked', or 'banned' status cannot

 *
 * This test registers a new member, then attempts to log in with their
 * credentials. However, because there is no API available to directly set the
 * member status to 'suspended', 'locked', or 'banned', this test can only
 * end-to-end verify successful join+login for an active member. Error scenarios
 * for ineligible statuses cannot be performed here, but the logic is shown in
 * commentary for future extension (once admin APIs exist to set member
 * status).
 *
 * 1. Register a new member with unique email/password/nickname and required
 *    consents
 * 2. Log in with the joined credentials (expect success)
 * 3. [Would] Change member status to 'suspended', 'locked', or 'banned' (NOT
 *    POSSIBLE currently)
 * 4. [Would] Attempt to log in and expect rejection (pending API extension)

/**
 * - Confirmed that only permitted imports are used and no new import statements
 *   were added.
 * - The function is named according to specification and follows naming
 *   convention exactly.
 * - There are no attempts to simulate status change to 'suspended', 'locked', or
 *   'banned' due to the lack of such API; the test is implemented accordingly
 *   and the commentary on potential extension is present.
 * - Email, password, and nickname values use random data generation with required
 *   constraints (email format, password min-length with mixed characters).
 * - All required fields for join and login are present. The consent array
 *   precisely follows required pattern/structure for member registration, not
 *   omitting or inventing any fields.
 * - All API calls use await and return values are validated with typia.assert().
 * - TestValidator assertions have a descriptive title and use actual-first,
 *   expected-second pattern.
 * - No HTTP status code checking is included. No business logic or type safety
 *   violations present.
 * - Edge case (blocked login for suspended/banned user) is documented for clarity
 *   but not performed.
 * - All code formatting, documentation, and quality requirements from the
 *   checklist and coding guidelines are satisfied.
