/**
 * - The draft attempts to directly omit required properties (ip_address,
 *   user_agent) from the request body for error case testing, then forcibly
 *   applies `as any` for type assertion. This is **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN**
 *   according to the guidelines and must be removed.
 * - Using `as any` to force a missing required property will not compile in
 *   TypeScript or will violate test standards. Negative tests for type-level
 *   enforcement are not allowed.
 * - The only valid business logic test is to confirm that a valid guest join
 *   works.
 * - The error-case tests that rely on type errors (`as any`) must be **entirely
 *   deleted**.
 * - The control flow (valid registration) is correct and must be kept as the only
 *   test.
 * - Title strings for `TestValidator` functions are proper, and all required
 *   await statements for async SDK calls are present.
 * - No additional imports were added. Type safety is violated only on the error
 *   cases.
 * - Final implementation must contain only the business logic valid test. All
 *   type error or required-field-missing tests must be omitted completely.
