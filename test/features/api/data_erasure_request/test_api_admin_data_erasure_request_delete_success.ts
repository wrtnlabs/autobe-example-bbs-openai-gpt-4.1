/**
 * Validate admin-driven successful soft deletion of a data erasure request
 * record.
 *
 * Scenario Steps:
 *
 * 1. Register a new user (who will also be elevated to admin for the purpose
 *    of privilege enforcement).
 * 2. Register this user as an admin using their UUID.
 * 3. As admin, submit a data erasure request targeting that user.
 * 4. As admin, delete (soft delete) the erasure request by its UUID.
 * 5. (API Limitation: No direct fetch or list endpoint for erased request to
 *    validate `deleted_at` or disappearanceâ€”so direct post-deletion
 *    validation is impossible.)
 *
 * This test ensures:
 *
 * - Admin privileges are effective and necessary for deletion.
 * - Data erasure request workflow supports creation and deletion.
 * - (Soft) deletion executes successfully without errors.
 * - For full post-deletion validation of `deleted_at`, an additional get/list
 *   endpoint would be required.
