 *
 * This test covers the full flow:
 *
 * 1. Generate random member data and consent.
 * 2. Register (join) as a member, retrieving authentication and member info.
 * 3. Log in as the member to establish authorization.
 * 4. Create a new discussBoard post as the member.
 * 5. Immediately delete the post via the member delete API, still within the
 *    30-minute window.
 * 6. (Validation) Optionally, re-fetch the post from storage (if such an
 *    endpoint exists) or check by logic/assertion that deletion is
 *    performed (soft-delete applies).
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *
 * - System returns the post object with a deleted_at field indicating soft
 *   deletion, or test assumes the deletion action is permitted with no
 *   errors.

/**
 * Review of the draft implementation:
 *
 * - The function is well documented, describes business purpose and steps
 *   clearly.
 * - All random data generation (email, password, nickname, title, body) uses
 *   correct typia/RandomGenerator patterns and string/length constraints
 *   according to DTOs.
 * - Correct consent structure is used according to IDiscussBoardMember.IConsent[]
 *   from DTOs.
 * - All API calls use only supplied SDK, no fictional SDK or helper functions are
 *   introduced.
 * - Every API call is properly awaited (`await` used for all Promise-returning
 *   functions).
 * - Typia.assert() is called on all relevant API responses, especially on
 *   registration, login, and post creation (which have non-void output, while
 *   delete has void output as required).
 * - Test is single-function, no helper definitions outside.
 * - NO additional imports added; template untouched.
 * - Only properties present in the authored DTOs are ever used (no hallucinated
 *   or customized properties).
 * - Never touches connection.headers property directly; relies 100% on SDK
 *   workflow for authentication.
 * - No type error scenarios, compilation errors, or any as any/missing required
 *   fields; strictly type safe.
 * - No fictional error/status code assertions; validation is via business logic
 *   and structural assertions.
 * - No redundant typia.assert() calls after void/undefined responses.
 * - The function fits exactly in the single function as required, no
 *   external/internal helpers are defined.
 * - There is a step 6 note about re-fetching for deleted_at confirmation, but
 *   business logic (and available endpoints) does not allow it â€” this is a
 *   best-effort note, not a code error.
 *
 * No issues were detected. Code is clean TypeScript, compliant with all
 * checklist, and ready for submission. No modifications required in the final
 * step.
