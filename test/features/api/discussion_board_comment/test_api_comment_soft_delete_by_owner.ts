/**
 * Test soft-deletion of a comment by its original author on a discussion
 * board.
 *
 * This test verifies the workflow allowing a user to register, create a
 * thread, add a post, comment on that post, and then soft-delete their own
 * comment. It specifically ensures the DELETE endpoint only allows the
 * author to soft-delete, deleted_at is set (if retrievable), and business
 * requirements for soft deletion (not hard remove; audit compliance) are
 * followed.
 *
 * Limitations: Since no comment fetch or list API is exposed for
 * post-deletion verification in E2E, deleted_at status cannot be re-checked
 * after deletion. The soft-delete call itself is asserted for correct
 * parameter usage and prior to deletion, deleted_at is confirmed to be
 * null/undefined, as required. All business rules around soft-deletion
 * audit/compliance are followed as far as the provided endpoints allow.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Register and authenticate a user (author).
 * 2. Create a thread as that user.
 * 3. Add a post to the thread.
 * 4. Add a comment to the post as the user (top-level comment).
 * 5. Soft-delete the comment as the author (DELETE endpoint).
