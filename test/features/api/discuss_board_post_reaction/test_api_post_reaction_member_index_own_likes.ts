/**
 * Review of the draft implementation:
 *
 * - Compilation: All code is valid TypeScript, using only types and functions
 *   defined in the provided DTOs and SDK. No type errors, no additional
 *   imports, correct async/await usage for all API calls.
 * - Import compliance: All imports left as in the template; no additions.
 * - Function structure: Function name and signature strictly match requirements.
 *   One parameter of type api.IConnection.
 * - All tests for type validation or intentionally sending wrong data types are
 *   absent (zero tolerance met).
 * - API function calls: All use the correct accessors, the correct
 *   request/response typing, and proper path/body property keys.
 * - Pagination: Retrieval uses the filter fields as described, correctly
 *   narrowing the search to member, post, and like reactions.
 * - TestValidator: All usage includes descriptive title first, actual-first,
 *   expected-second ordering. No generic or unclear assertion titles. No type
 *   errors in usage.
 * - Only one member/post/reaction is created, which is sufficient for the
 *   described coverage but avoids confusion over unrelated data. No
 *   cross-record test pollution.
 * - Comment/documentation: JSDoc is included at the top, clearly explaining the
 *   business process, per project convention. All major steps have useful
 *   inline comments for clarity.
 * - Handling null/undefined: No nullable or optional property issues are present;
 *   all handled as per strict TypeScript safety. No ! or as Type assertions
 *   used; validation is done with typia.assert where needed.
 * - No attempts at type error testing, HTTP status code testing, or missing
 *   property/malformed request testing; zero tolerance conditions satisfied.
 * - Proper use of typia.random, RandomGenerator, and never omitting required
 *   properties.
 *
 * FINAL FIXES: There were no code or logic errors; all patterns required by the
 * prompt were followed, so the final implementation is identical to the draft.
