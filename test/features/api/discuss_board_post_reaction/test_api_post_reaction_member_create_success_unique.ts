/**
 * All implementation steps are correct:
 *
 * - The scenario is structured to register two members (author and reaction
 *   giver), create a post, and submit a reaction from the second member only.
 * - All API calls use await, correct function signatures, and type-safe
 *   parameters.
 * - Random data is generated for all required DTO fields using correct
 *   typia/random or RandomGenerator functions.
 * - Requests use only schema-defined properties. No hallucinated or non-existent
 *   fields are present.
 * - All TestValidator calls use actual-first, expected-second pattern and provide
 *   descriptive titles.
 * - Duplicate reaction error is enforced using TestValidator.error with an async
 *   callback.
 * - No type error testing, HTTP status testing, or forbidden patterns are
 *   present.
 * - No connection.headers manipulation, no additional imports, and no template
 *   code modification.
 * - Null/undefined and required properties are handled as required by DTOs. No
 *   property omission or non-null assertion anti-patterns are present.
 * - Business logic sequence of registration, posting, and reactivity is
 *   respected.
 * - The generated code is comprehensive, maintainable, and readable. This
 *   implementation fully meets all system requirements and the test is
 *   production-quality. No further changes are needed.
