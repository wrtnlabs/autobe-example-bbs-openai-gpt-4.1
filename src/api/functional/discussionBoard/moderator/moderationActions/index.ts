/**
 * Create a new moderation action (warn, remove, restrict, etc.) by a moderator
 * or admin.
 *
 * Create a new moderation action record to log activity performed by moderators
 * or admins for enforcement of platform policies. This includes actions against
 * users, posts, or commentsâ€”such as warning, restricting, muting, removing, or
 * restoring content. The API requires identifying the acting moderator, the
 * target (user, post, or comment), specifying the type of moderation action
 * (e.g., warn, mute, remove, restore), the reason for the action, and relevant
 * effective timing. All actions are recorded in the moderation_actions schema
 * for audit and compliance.
 *
 * Security is ensured by restricting this endpoint to users with moderator or
 * admin roles; each action taken is logged and auditable. Linked records must
 * exist in the target tables (users, posts, or comments). Business logic will
 * validate action-specific requirements (such as only allowing restore actions
 * on content previously removed), and rejection reasons are clearly reported.
 *
 * Expected behavior includes auditing/traceability and propagation of
 * moderation effects to related user/content state. This endpoint upholds
 * community integrity, enables regulatory compliance, and is a primary
 * interface for staff moderation activities.
 *
 * @param props.connection
 * @param props.body Information about the moderation action to record,
 *   including action type, target, reason, and timing.
