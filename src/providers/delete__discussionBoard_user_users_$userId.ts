/**
 * Soft delete (deactivate) a user account by userId (sets deleted_at).
 *
 * Soft-deletes a user account in the discussion board by marking the deleted_at
 * field with the current timestamp for the user referenced by userId. This
 * operation makes the account inaccessible to regular users but retains the
 * record and key metadata for compliance, moderation, and auditing.
 *
 * Account removal respects all standard soft deletion patterns, meaning all
 * direct relations (posts, comments, etc.) are not removed but may be hidden or
 * anonymized from public view according to business logic. The operation
 * requires self-authorization unless escalated (e.g., by moderators/admins).
 * Complies with user data erasure policies, enabling administrators and users
 * to initiate their own account removal.
 *
 * A successful deletion will only affect logical removalâ€”not physical deletion.
 * Related APIs must handle visibility of soft-deleted records and include
 * compliance with any legal erasure requirements.
 *
 * @param props - Properties for the request
 * @param props.user - The authenticated user (must match userId)
 * @param props.userId - The unique identifier of the account to be soft-deleted
 * @returns Void
 * @throws {Error} When attempting to delete an account other than self
 * @throws {Error} When user does not exist
