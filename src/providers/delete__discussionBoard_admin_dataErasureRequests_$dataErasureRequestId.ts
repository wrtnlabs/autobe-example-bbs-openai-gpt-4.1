/**
 * Permanently remove a data erasure request for compliance/audit management.
 *
 * This operation sets the `deleted_at` field on the targeted data erasure
 * request in compliance records, performing a soft delete (not a hard delete)
 * in accordance with platform data retention and audit requirements. Only
 * system administrators may perform this operation; compliance is enforced by
 * the presence of the `admin` parameter.
 *
 * If the specified request has already been deleted or does not exist, an error
 * is thrown. No actual user data is deletedâ€”only the request record is marked
 * as deleted for audit traceability.
 *
 * @param props - Request properties
 * @param props.admin - The authenticated admin user performing the deletion
 * @param props.dataErasureRequestId - The UUID of the data erasure request to
 *   be deleted
 * @returns Void
 * @throws {Error} If the data erasure request does not exist or is already
 *   deleted
