Service: Political/Economic Discussion Board (discussionBoard)
Assigned Document: 10-error-handling-and-recovery.md

Purpose: To describe all foreseeable business error conditions, user-facing error and recovery policies, moderator/admin edge cases, and critical event logging for the discussionBoard system, so backend developers can implement error handling and resilience strictly according to business requirements.

Core Business Context:
- Heavy sensitivity: Political/economic discussions often involve public, heated, or controversial topics requiring careful user communication on errors/restrictions
- System priorities: Legal/audit compliance, clear notification, full role-based traceability, and no information leaks

Roles Referenced:
- visitor: Can only view/search public content; receives read-only errors
- user: Can participate fully, receives actionable error feedback
- moderator: Receives enhanced feedback on moderation actions/errors
- admin: Receives system-level/error escalation notifications, expected to respond to audit requirements

Scope:
- Covers authentication, input validation, content submission, moderation, admin actions, outages, scheduled downtime, logging, and audit needs
- Error handling requirements must use EARS syntax where applicable and be strictly business/role-focused
- Explicitly out of scope: UI design, frontend validation, technical exception handling, implementation/architecture choices, underlying frameworks or libraries

Document Structure:
- Introduction and guiding principles for error/resilience
- Role-based analysis of common error scenarios
- Feedback/notification policy for users and staff
- Requirements for handling unrecoverable errors, large-scale outages, and disaster scenarios
- Audit and compliance event logging
- Success and performance criteria (timeliness/clarity of user-facing errors/logs)
- Mermaid diagrams and Markdown tables provided for clarity
