# Non-Functional Requirements for Political/Economic Discussion Board

## Introduction
Non-functional requirements define critical quality metrics and operational standards for the political/economic discussion board (discussBoard). These criteria govern not just what the system does but how reliably, efficiently, and securely it serves all usersâ€”guests, members, moderators, and administrators. Ensuring these standards are met is essential for providing a trustworthy, accessible forum for high-value discussions at all times.

## Performance Expectations
- THE system SHALL provide page loads and visible responses to user actions (view, post, comment, react, moderate) within 2 seconds for 95% of all standard requests under normal operation.
- THE system SHALL process high-frequency actions (search, pagination, content refresh) with a response time of 1 second or less for the majority of cases.
- WHEN posting, commenting, or reacting, THE system SHALL confirm completion or error outcome to the user within 2 seconds.
- WHEN an operation exceeds 3 seconds, THE system SHALL notify the user of the delay or error through an appropriate message.
- IF a time-critical backend process fails or stalls beyond 5 seconds, THEN THE system SHALL present an actionable error describing recovery steps, if available.
- THE system SHALL support real-time user updates (such as moderation actions on posts removals or bans) being reflected across relevant interfaces within 30 seconds.
- Performance degradation SHALL not result in data loss or silent failure; all errors SHALL be detected and communicated to users where applicable.

## Scalability and Concurrency
- THE system SHALL support a minimum of 10,000 concurrent users actively browsing, posting, and interacting during peak loads.
- THE system design SHALL allow scaling to accommodate community growth, with target capacity increases up to 100,000+ registered users within 2 years.
- WHEN user activity approaches 80% of current capacity, THE system SHALL enable administrators to configure resource scaling or trigger pre-defined scaling workflows.
- THE system SHALL manage spikes in new posts, comments, and reactions without excessive queueing or denial of service, preserving a smooth experience for normal interactions.
- WHEN a rapid influx of traffic (spike of 5x average users in less than 5 minutes) occurs, THE system SHALL gracefully degrade (e.g., temporarily throttle non-essential background tasks, prioritize core features) and maintain essential user interactions without data corruption or unplanned downtime.
- THE system SHALL support distributed deployments for fault tolerance and horizontal scaling as needed, subject to business growth.

## Availability and Uptime Targets
- THE system SHALL be available 99.5% of the time during any rolling 30-day period, excluding agreed maintenance windows.
- WHEN planned maintenance is scheduled, THE system SHALL notify all users (visible banners or notifications) at least 24 hours in advance with start/end times clearly communicated.
- WHEN an unplanned outage occurs, THE system SHALL present an outage notice and a brief status indicator to both authenticated and non-authenticated users within 120 seconds of incident detection.
- THE system SHALL support automatic failover and backup restoration to minimize service interruption for critical failures.
- IF a node or component fails (e.g., storage, compute, or application server), THEN THE system SHALL recover within 15 minutes, restoring session continuity and previously saved user content where possible.

## Data Retention and Backup Policies
- THE system SHALL retain all user-generated content (posts, comments, reactions, reports, logs) for a minimum of 5 years unless legal, privacy, or regulatory requirements specify otherwise.
- THE system SHALL allow administrators to configure retention policies for logs, audit trails, and content according to evolving business/legal standards.
- User data flagged for deletion (by user request or moderation) SHALL be permanently removed from primary storage and any active caches within 30 days.
- BACKUP snapshots of all critical data SHALL be performed at least once every 24 hours, with recoverable, encrypted backups stored securely for a minimum of 90 days.
- WHEN a data recovery process is triggered, THE system SHALL restore the last successful backup and notify administrators within 60 minutes of restoration completion.
- IF an unauthorized access or data breach is detected, THEN THE system SHALL enforce business rules for immediate user notification, session revocation, and regulatory disclosure in compliance with related security/privacy documents.

## Maintenance and Support Expectations
- Planned maintenance windows SHALL be predictable, favoring low-usage periods (e.g., 01:00-05:00 local time).
- THE system SHALL support administrators in pushing urgent security updates or critical bug fixes within 4 hours of serious incident detection.
- Routine, non-urgent platform upgrades SHALL be prepared, tested, and deployed at least once per quarter, with clear change communications to all affected roles.
- THE system SHALL provide detailed error logging and monitoring dashboards for all major back-end components, accessible to administrators and support staff.
- THE system SHALL enable secure, audit-trailed admin access for maintenance tasks, configuration changes, and system inspections, following least-privilege policies.
- WHEN a system issue is detected by monitoring, THE system SHALL create automated incident alerts for assigned support contacts within 3 minutes.
- THE system SHALL offer a user-facing feedback or support mechanism for reporting technical issues or suggesting improvements, with submissions acknowledged within one business day.
