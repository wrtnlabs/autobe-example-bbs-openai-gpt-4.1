## Primary User Journeys

### Posting (Create, Edit, Delete)
- WHEN a user writes a new post in a topic category, THE system SHALL store and publish the post with user and timestamp metadata.
- WHEN a user edits their post within the editable window (e.g. 30 minutes), THE system SHALL update the content while preserving edit history.
- IF a user deletes their post, THEN THE system SHALL remove it from public view, retain audit trail for moderators, and adjust counts/statistics.
- WHERE posts contain prohibited content (e.g. hate speech, spam), THE system SHALL flag them for moderator review automatically.
- WHILE a thread is locked or archived, THE system SHALL prevent any further postings or edits.
- IF a visitor attempts to create or interact with content, THEN THE system SHALL deny with a login prompt and no data loss.

### Commenting (Add, Respond, Manage)
- WHEN a user submits a comment to a post, THE system SHALL append it to the thread, update discussion state, and trigger notifications as per user settings.
- WHERE comments break community rules, THE system SHALL allow rapid flagging by users, with immediate concealment after exceeding flag threshold.
- IF a user deletes their comment, THEN THE system SHALL make it invisible to others but retain for moderation.
- WHEN a thread is locked, THE system SHALL deny new comment submissions with a user-facing message.

### Voting and Polling
- WHEN a user upvotes or downvotes a post/comment, THE system SHALL update the tally, recalculate rankings, and prevent duplicate votes per identity.
- WHERE posts or comments feature polls, THE system SHALL allow one vote per authenticated user, lock results upon poll closure, and display aggregated outcome.
- IF suspicious voting patterns (e.g. mass votes from one IP) are detected, THEN THE system SHALL flag for review and may temporarily suspend vote count display.

### Reporting/Flagging Content
- WHEN a user flags a post or comment, THE system SHALL record the reason, notify the moderation queue, and take automatic action (conceal, lock) if needed.
- WHERE content is already under review, THE system SHALL indicate status and prevent further user reporting until resolution.
- IF a flagged item is resolved by moderator (approved/rejected), THEN THE system SHALL notify reporters of outcome and update community logs.

## Moderator and Admin Flows

### Moderation Queue and Content Review
- WHEN new content is flagged, THE system SHALL queue it for moderators with associated metadata (user, reason, history).
- WHEN a moderator reviews a flagged item, THE system SHALL display full context, prior actions, and enable decision logging (approve, remove, warn, escalate).
- WHERE repeated offenders are detected, THE system SHALL surface their pattern for moderation attention.
- IF an action is taken, THEN THE system SHALL notify the affected user with reasons and update logs for auditability.

### Enforcement Actions (Suspension, Warning)
- WHEN moderators suspend a user, THE system SHALL immediately revoke their posting and voting privileges, logging the cause and period.
- WHEN a warning is issued to a user, THE system SHALL deliver a message explaining breach and remediation steps.
- IF an appeal is filed, THEN THE system SHALL escalate to admin for review and document final resolution.

### Admin System Controls
- WHEN admins update category structures, THE system SHALL apply changes system-wide, migrate affected posts, and communicate the updates to all users.
- WHEN system-wide compliance or policy changes are made, THE system SHALL display banners or notifications for required acknowledgement by users.
- THE system SHALL enable full export of logs, user actions, and compliance reports for audit purposes.

## Edge Cases and Alternate Paths

### Guest Interactions
- IF a visitor tries to interact beyond browsing (post, comment, vote, report), THEN THE system SHALL prompt for authentication and retain any entered text for later upon login.

### Suspended or Banned Users
- WHILE a user is suspended, THE system SHALL block all participation but allow reading and appeals interface.
- IF a banned user attempts to access the system, THEN THE system SHALL present ban reason and appeal options where relevant.

### Locked or Archived Threads
- WHILE a thread is locked or archived (by moderator/admin), THE system SHALL deny any further contributions but retain all content in read-only mode for transparency.

### High-Volume/Controversial Topics
- WHEN a thread receives a spike in activity or is marked as sensitive, THE system SHALL throttle new posting rates, activate enhanced moderation visibility, and display thread status to users.
- IF the system detects coordinated abuse or bot activity, THEN THE system SHALL activate automatic lockdown on affected threads and alert moderators/admins.

## User Value and Experience
- THE system SHALL ensure transparency by providing feedback on moderation and reporting workflows to all participants.
- WHEN user actions trigger moderation or automated system events, THE system SHALL explain outcomes, status, and escalation paths clearly.
- WHERE community milestones are reached (e.g. post count, engagement), THE system SHALL celebrate and inform the user base for increased engagement.
- THE system SHALL prioritize safety, civil discourse, and inclusivity throughout all touchpoints, ensuring users feel respected and empowered to participate or dissent responsibly.
