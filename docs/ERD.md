### `discuss_board_settings`

Global system configuration for the discussBoard platform. Holds
platform-wide settings such as max post/comment length, maintenance mode
flag, notification policies, data retention periods, or any feature flag
toggles. Managed exclusively by administrators, sets the foundation for
all application logic and enforcement. Only one row should exist at any
time.

Properties as follows:

- `id`: Primary Key.
- `config_json`
  > JSON string of system-wide configurable options such as ratios, toggle
  > flags, policy versions, and detailed policy parameters.
- `created_at`: Timestamp of when this settings record was created.
- `updated_at`: Timestamp of last update to settings record.

### `discuss_board_forbidden_words`

Catalog of keywords, phrases, or regexes forbidden from user content due
to policy violations (e.g., hate speech, profanity, spam). Used for
filtering post and comment content at creation or update. Managed by
administrators and updated as guideline policies evolve. Each word or
expression is unique and case-insensitive.

Properties as follows:

- `id`: Primary Key.
- `expression`: Forbidden word, phrase, or regex pattern (case-insensitive).
- `description`
  > Administrative description, business rationale, or policy context for
  > this forbidden word or pattern.
- `created_at`: Time this forbidden word or pattern was registered.
- `updated_at`: Last update time for this record.
- `deleted_at`
  > Soft delete flag: time this entry was removed by administrators, if
  > applicable.

### `discuss_board_privacy_logs`

Audit records for all privacy-sensitive actions taken on user data.
Entries document accesses, exports, deletions, and policy updates
impacting user information, with who did it, which data subject,
operation type, outcome, and timestamp. Provides a robust audit trail for
privacy compliance and incident response. References user/account ids in
other tables for traceability, but never stores confidential data
directly.

Properties as follows:

- `id`: Primary Key.
- `actor_user_account_id`
  > Reference to the user account that performed the privacy-related action.
  > [discuss_board_user_accounts.id](#discuss_board_user_accounts).
- `data_subject_user_account_id`
  > Reference to the data subject impacted by the action (could be same as
  > actor, or another user). [discuss_board_user_accounts.id](#discuss_board_user_accounts).
- `action_type`
  > Type of privacy operation (access, export, delete, policy update, consent
  > change, etc.).
- `description`
  > Business context or justification for the privacy operation, including
  > outcome or relevant audit notes.
- `result_status`
  > Result of the privacy action (success, failure, partial). For audit
  > reporting.
- `created_at`: Timestamp when this action was performed (UTC).

### `discuss_board_consent_records`

Stores individual user consent events for privacy, terms of service, or
other legal agreements. Contains who provided consent, policy/document
version, consent action (granted, revoked, updated), and timestamp.
Required for legal defensibility and to fulfill user data rights
requests. Each event is preserved historicallyâ€”this table acts as an
append-only log.

Properties as follows:

- `id`: Primary Key.
- `user_account_id`
  > User account giving or updating consent. {@link
  > discuss_board_user_accounts.id}.
- `policy_type`
  > Type of policy for which consent is being tracked (e.g. 'privacy_policy',
  > 'terms_of_service', 'marketing_opt_in').
- `policy_version`
  > Version or identifier of the policy/legal document the user is consenting
  > to.
- `consent_action`: What the event represents: (e.g. 'granted', 'revoked', 'updated').
- `description`
  > Optional business notes regarding the consent record, such as rationale
  > or evidence (IP address, device, etc.).
- `created_at`: Timestamp when this consent record/event was created (UTC).

tracks the reporting user, reported content (post or comment), type of
content, report reason, status, and workflow timestamps. Used by
moderators and administrators to triage, review, and resolve complaints
submitted by members. References actors in user-related tables, and
content in posts/comments. Enables searching all reports, viewing by
content, user, or resolution status. Essential for strict audit trails
and abuse prevention. Supports one-to-many relationships with moderation
actions (an action may resolve multiple reports).

Properties as follows:

- `id`: Primary Key.
- `reporter_member_id`
  > Reporting user's [discuss_board_members.id](#discuss_board_members). References the member
  > who submitted the report.
- `content_post_id`
  > Reported post's [discuss_board_posts.id](#discuss_board_posts). Exactly one of
  > content_post_id or content_comment_id must be non-null. References the
  > reported post, if this report is for a post.
- `content_comment_id`
  > Reported comment's [discuss_board_comments.id](#discuss_board_comments). Exactly one of
  > content_post_id or content_comment_id must be non-null. References the
  > reported comment, if this report is for a comment.
- `content_type`
  > Type of content being reported (e.g., 'post', 'comment'). Required to
  > determine which foreign key applies. Ensures correct content reference
  > and workflow routing.
- `reason`
  > Reporter-supplied reason for the report. Collected from predefined list
  > (spam, harassment, abuse, misinformation) or freeform up to 200
  > characters. Used for workflow triage and full-text search by moderators.
- `status`
  > Current workflow status (pending, under_review, resolved, dismissed,
  > escalated). Used for moderation queue, progress, and reporting.
- `moderation_action_id`
  > ID of the associated moderation action (if resolved). Used for historical
  > workflow, linking to decisions/actions. Nullableâ€”assigned only when
  > resolution occurs.
- `created_at`
  > UTC creation timestamp for the report, required for audit and
  > chronological workflow.
- `updated_at`: UTC last updated timestamp.
- `deleted_at`: UTC deleted timestamp, set if report is soft deleted (for compliance).

### `discuss_board_moderation_actions`

Tracks actionable moderation decisions (e.g., content removal, warning,
user suspension) initiated as the resolution of reports or other
triggers. Includes responsible moderator/admin, target content/user, type
of action, reason, decision narrative, and linkage to appeal if present.
